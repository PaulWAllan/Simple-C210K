Simple C210K (Continue to 10k) is a very simple, free and open source application that can be used to follw the Bridge to 10k (b210k) running plan. After every interval the phone will vibrate and beep to let you know you have to start or stop running. The application can run entirely in the background so playing your own music during your exercise will not be a problem.

If you have any suggestions for improvement of this application or if you have problems using it send me an email and I'll see what I can do.
